// Library for Adafruit 8x8 LED matrix watch.  (C) Adafruit Industries.
// Displays 1- to 8-bit monochrome graphics with one row of 8, 4, 2 or 1
// LED enabled at a time, using a fast timer interrupt and bit angle
// modulation (vs PWM).  AVR sleep modes are used where possible to
// conserve power.  Requires Adafruit_GFX library.

// This code looks ridiculous and requires quite a bit of explanation...

// First, some parts might be painful to read in that 'row' and 'column'
// here refer to the hardware pin functions as described in the LED matrix
// datasheet...but, with the matrix installed sideways in the watch for
// better component placement, these aren't the same as 'row' and 'column'
// visually as we usually consider them in computer graphics.  So...the
// higher-level graphics drawing functions use conventional X/Y coordinates
// from the top left of the face of the watch as normally worn, while the
// lower-level code (most of this library) takes care of mapping this to
// the native orientation of the LED matrix.

// Maybe more important is memory usage.  This library is the biggest RAM
// hog in the history of RAM hogs, but this came about by design rather
// than negligence.  The primary focus of the entire library is to reduce
// the matrix-refresh interrupt handler to the fewest instructions and the
// shortest possible interval, permitting smoother screen refresh (less
// apparent flicker) and more opportunities to put the CPU in a low-power
// sleep state.  All other considerations take a back seat to getting in
// and out of that interrupt as quickly as possible.  The shortest route
// to achieve this is to store a ton of precomputed stuff in RAM.

// The 8x8 LED matrix, like most, is 'multiplexed' to display one row or
// column at a time (this library does one column at a time...but that's
// 'column' in the datasheet sense, recall from above that this is 'row'
// in the visual sense).  The row and column lines that drive the display
// are spread across three PORT registers.  Rather than store a memory-
// efficient representation of the screen bitmap (8 bytes for an 8x8, 1-bit
// image) and then having code rearrange this across the three PORTs on
// *every single interrupt call*, screen data is instead stored in a format
// that can be copied directly to the three PORTs...so each 8-pixel, 1-bit
// column of the display actually consumes three bytes of RAM instead of
// one (quite a few bits go unused).  A full 8x8 pixel 1-bit image thus
// requires 24 bytes of RAM, not 8 bytes.  Oink oink factor 3.

// For a multi-bit image (i.e. 'grayscale,' disregarding the color of the
// LED matrix), each additional bitplane consumes another 24 bytes.  So a
// 1-bit image is 24 bytes, while a 4-bit image (16 brightness levels)
// needs 24x4 or 96 bytes, and an 8-bit image (256 levels) requires 24x8
// or 192 bytes.

// Because the watch runs off a single lithium coin cell, there's a very
// real need to conserve power....heavy current draw will deplete the
// battery with disproportionate speed.  A significant power saving can be
// achieved by driving fewer than the full 8 LEDs of a column and using
// broader multiplexing...for example, rather than 8 LEDs x 8 columns, the
// library can multiplex 4 LEDs x 16 half-columns, 2 LEDs x 32 quarter-
// columns, or 1 LED x 64 eighth-columns.  But again, with the interrupt
// speed taking precedence, this is achieved by storing multiple full 8-LED
// columns that each only have some fraction of the LEDs enabled, because
// this is faster than masking out bits every single time.  Somewhat
// counter-intuitively, the fewer LEDs on at a time, the more RAM is spent
// in this manner.  For example, driving 4 (rather than 8) LEDs at a time,
// there are essentially two copies of image data in RAM -- one with even
// rows enabled and one with odd rows -- but each still requiring the full
// 24 bytes of data (times the number of bitplanes).  An 8-bit image
// displaying 4 LEDs at a time now requires 24x8x2 or 384 bytes just for
// this small 8x8 grid.  2 LEDs at a time requires 4 passes, while 1 LED
// requires 8 passes.  It becomes necessary to cut back the number of
// bitplanes as this approaches the total free RAM available on the MCU!
// Running more LEDs at a time saves RAM, but draws more power.  The right
// balance must be found between looking nice and preserving scarce battery
// power.  Since the application has only modest needs beyond showing a
// watch face, there's little guilt in sacrificing ridiculous amounts of
// RAM to meet these goals.

// Finally, double-buffering -- a means of achieving flicker-free animation
// by maintaining separate on- and off-screen buffers -- doubles the screen
// memory requirements yet again.

// Screen RAM requirements can thus be calculated as follows:
// 24 bytes * bitplanes * passes * buffers, where:
// Brightness levels = 2^bitplanes; e.g. 1 plane = 2 levels, 2 planes = 4...
// LEDs = 2^(4-passes); e.g. 8 LEDs = 1 pass, 4 LEDs = 2 passes, etc.
// Buffers = 1 (single-buffered) or 2 (double-buffered).
// e.g. 16-level, 4 LEDs at a time, double buffered = 24*4*2*2 = 384 bytes.

// The available display RAM has been fixed at 768 bytes.  This allows
// the following maximum bit depths for various multiplex factors:
// 8 LED (1 pass), double buf: 8 bits max
// 4 LED (2 pass), double buf: 8 bits max
// 2 LED (4 pass), double buf: 4 bits max
// 1 LED (8 pass), double buf: 2 bits max

// The 'off' state for rows and columns is different because one represents
// anodes and the other cathodes.  So this weird combination of bits sets
// all rows and columns to their respective 'off' states:
#define PORTB_OFF B11001010
#define PORTC_OFF B00110011 // PC4, PC5 are set to enable I2C pullups
#define PORTD_OFF B11001100 // PD2, PD3 are set to enable button pullups

// Because the LED matrix ties up so many of the microcontroller's pins,
// the idea of object-orientating the code for multiple instances is a bit
// nonsensical.  It's done insofar as Adafruit_GFX can be used, but all
// the matrix-specific variables and such are simply declared in the code
// here rather than in private vars.  Keeps the interrupt code simple.
